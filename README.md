# Overview

This is a simple snake game using the Rust programming language. Snake games are perfect for understanding a new language because you get to work with objects, structures, graphics, UI, and game engines which exposes you to many important aspects of the language.

This snake game is very simple, you start as a red dot and as you eat the black pieces of food, your body gets bigger with every bite. If you hit any of the 4 walls or yourself, the game is over the score is displayed in the terminal with how many pieces of food you successfully ate.

Below is a demonstration of the program.

Some helpful websites that helped me:
* [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)
* [Hello world tutorial to get everything working for first time using Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWcIZFGiKr0)

# Future Work

* I would like to have the score show up on the screen as you are playing rather than at the end when it is done.
* I would also like to have the snake look a bit better and more like a snake using sprites.
* Lastly have a main menu and pause screen implemented.
